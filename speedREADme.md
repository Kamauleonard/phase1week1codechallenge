##Speed Detector Program
This simple speed detector program is written in JavasSCript.
Save the avaScript files in your machine.

Once you run the program, you will be prompted to enter speed in numeric form.
THe program will display "OK" if the speed is below 70.
For every 5km/hr increase above the 70km/hr speed limit, you will get delimit points.
The program will display the points you have earned based on the speed.

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS
The program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), 
it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it prints: 
“Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.
